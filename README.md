## Features

-   Faster Onboarding: Quick, 2-step registration process to link your vehicle to a wallet
-   Flexible: Facility to link more than one vehicle to a single wallet
-   Security out of the box: All transactions must be approved before money is debited!\*

From the team,

> Imagine a situation where you board a ferry, and the amount to be paid is automatically debited.<br/>
> Imagine a situation where you just drive through a toll, and amount gets debited automatically, without the need to stop<br/>
> Imagine a situation where you place an order in a drivethrough, and payment happens automatically<br/>
> Imagine a situation, where you can track your stolen vehicles location and report to law enforcement<br/>
> Imagine a situation, where ......<br/>

Okay, I get your point - automatic, in-vehicle payments/security solutions right? Yes. ðŸ™‚

## Entities Involved

-   **User:** An entity who uses the PlatePay User app, to register their vehicles and link them to the digital wallet. He can then recharge the wallet periodically, and make payments.
-   **Merchant:** An entity who uses the hardware provided by us, along with the proprietary software installed on it, to receive payments from the users. He is someone who has multiple outlets under him, and wishes to accept payments. The system allows him to debit money from the user's linked wallet, provided the user approves this transaction by going into the user app.
-   **Special Merchants/Privileged Users:** Eg. RTO, Govt, etc who can debit the money without requesting the user. In other words, their debit will be approved directly, without awaiting user consent. (Please Note, this is different from preauthorized merchants, where user provides consent to debit certain amount, normally less than 2k, without awaiting per-transaction approval)
